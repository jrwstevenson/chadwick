  Theres a guy I know that says I'm the most caring person he knows. All I know is that I have a lot of time for those close to me and for those who need it.

  I like to leave hair dryers everywhere, just in case someone needs to use it, or in case I ever go back.

  You cannot beat a good cup of tea in the morning. I try to get 3 in before I leave the house. I'll even take one to the shower to drink while my conditioner works it magic!

  I have had a grand total of 2 Singapore Slings. I'm reliably informed that one of them wasn't even a Singapore Sling, but they were both lovely.
